# KIITopedia Project Documentation

## Introduction
KIITopedia is a dynamic and responsive social media platform in a 4-person team using modern web development technologies and frameworks like React, NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, Redux and JWT, with features like authorization, real-time state management, content sharing, and a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure
The KIITopedia project is organized into a client-side and a server-side, indicating a clear separation of concerns between front-end and back-end operations. This structure is typical of full-stack applications, allowing for efficient development and maintenance of the project.

### Client
The `client` directory is expected to contain the front end of the application. This is the part of the application that users interact with directly. It's responsible for presenting data to users and handling user interactions.

The front end is likely built with JavaScript, possibly utilizing a library or framework like React.js for building the user interface. This would involve creating various components to represent different parts of the user interface and managing the state of these components.

The use of HTML and CSS in the project suggests that the front end also involves creating the structural layout of the web pages and styling them to provide a good user experience.

### Server
The `server` directory is where the backend of the application is implemented. The backend is responsible for processing requests from the front end, interacting with databases, and sending responses back to the front end.

Given that the project is primarily written in JavaScript, it's likely that the backend is implemented using Node.js. Express.js might be used as a web application framework to handle routing and middleware.

The backend would also be responsible for tasks such as user authentication, data validation, and error handling.

### README.md
The `README.md` file typically serves as a guide providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to set up and use the project. However, the current README for this project is quite sparse and doesn't offer much detail. It would be beneficial for the project to have a more detailed README, including information about the project's purpose, its features, how to set up and run the project, and how to contribute.

## Languages and Technologies
The project is primarily written in JavaScript (97.7%), with minor portions in HTML (2.1%) and CSS (0.2%). This suggests a web-based application, with JavaScript handling both client-side and server-side logic, HTML providing the structure of web pages, and CSS adding styles to the HTML elements.

## Getting Started
As of now, the repository does not provide specific instructions for setting up and running the project. Typically, this would involve steps like:

1. Cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. Installing the necessary dependencies, usually with a package manager like npm or yarn.
3. Setting up any necessary environment variables, such as database connection details or API keys.
4. Starting the development server, often with a command like `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Contributing
Contributions to the KIITopedia project are welcome! If you're interested in contributing, you can start by forking the repository and cloning it to your local machine. From there, you can make changes to the code and submit a pull request. Contributions could include adding new features, fixing bugs, improving the user interface, or enhancing the project documentation.

## Conclusion
KIITopedia appears to be a promising project with the potential to serve as a valuable resource for the KIIT community. However, the lack of detailed documentation makes it challenging to understand the project's full scope and functionality. For more accurate information, consider reaching out to the repository owner or watching the

repository for updates and more detailed documentation in the future.

The project's structure and the technologies used suggest a robust full-stack application, with a frontend built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and a backend built with Node.js and Express.js. This combination of technologies is popular in modern web development due to its flexibility, efficiency, and ability to use JavaScript across the entire stack.

Despite the current lack of detailed documentation, KIITopedia is a testament to the power of open-source collaboration. As the project evolves and more contributors join, it has the potential to become a comprehensive and valuable platform for the KIIT community.
