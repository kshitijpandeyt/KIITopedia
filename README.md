# KIITopedia

This project is a complete, full-stack, responsive and dynamic social media application build for the students of our college KIIT University named “KIITopedia” using the MERN stack.

It consists of a register page with complete validation along with functionality to upload a user image for our profile. It also has a home page where we can see our posts, news feed, and friend list. The application also allows us to make posts, add images to posts, and edit or delete posts. It also allows us to like posts, comment on posts, add friends, and change the theme between light mode and dark mode.

The objective of this project was to provide the students of the university their own personal social media space without external intervention and full privacy.
